What is the offline "internet" project? The offline "internet project is a collection of .html files. Why .html files? Because 1. they run in your browser and, 2. html is about all i know. Why is it offline? It is offline so it can be downloaded and used in places without wifi. If its offline then isn't it not the internet? Thats why i put quotes around internet, because it is not online.
